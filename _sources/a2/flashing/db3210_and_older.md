![A2Uploader Steps](/_static/a2flasher_1.png)

1. Add both your `.mbn` and `.fbn` files
2. Add your customization pack (as a `.zip`)
3. Press flash


It should ask yo to remove the battery, insert it back after 5 seconds and then inserting the USB cable while holding C. Once detected, the flashing process starts. When done, unplug the USB cable, remove the battery, insert it back after 5 seconds, start the phone and it should boot on the freshly flashed firmware after a few progress bars.
