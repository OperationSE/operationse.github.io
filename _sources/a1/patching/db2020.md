# DB2020

To patch your phone, you need to break it beforehand, once that's done and everything works, launch FAR Manager, open JDF, and select `qa2020` as the script now that QuickAccess has been flashed.

Once that's done, press "jump down into a large rabbit hole", remove the battery, put it back in after 5 seconds and plug in your phone while holding C.

When JDF is done loading, this screen should appear

Select `bflash`, and then this familiar screen should re-appear

Now flashing patches is possible, as done before by selecting them in the other pane, copying them by pressing F5, selecting "Copy" and then selecting `as a vkp patch`.

After patches are applied, unplug and reboot the phone, it should be patched.
