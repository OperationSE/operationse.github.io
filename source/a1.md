## Flashing
### XS ++
This tool is quite straightforward to use. First off, you're going to need the main firwmare, the filesystem for that firmware and a customization pack, which should be available for your phone in the "Files" section.

Upon launching the tool, you should see this screen:

![XS++ main screen](/_static/xspp_1.png)

To put the phone into recovery mode, you should now remove your phone's battery, put it back in, hold the C key while connecting the phone to the computer and click "Connect"

Once it's done, you'll have a screen that looks like this 

![XS++ pre-flash screen](/_static/xspp_2.png)

Now you have to supply your main firmware (`.mbn`) file, and your filesystem in the corresponding sections.
For the customization pack, you need to unzip it in a folder next to your XS++ executable called `own_custpack`.
Once done, the `own_custpack` folder should only contain a folder called `tpa`.

Before flashing, the tool should be in this state

![XS++ pre-flash screen filled](/_static/xspp_3.png)

Now, click flash and wait for it to finish flashing (it should take around 5-10 minutes)

Once done, remove your phone, remove its battery, put it back and power it on.

## Breaking
### DB2020 CID52 and before
This process is going to be a little bit more involved than flashing the phone. First off, make a Quick Access patch by dragging your `.mbn` firmware file on `qamaker.exe`, save this patch in a place that's easily accessible

Now open FAR Manager, you're going to be greeted by this screen.

![FAR Manager](/_static/farman.png)

Now press F11 to open the plugins menu and select `just da flasher`, you should be greeted with this prompt

![justdaflasher prompt](/_static/farman_jdf1.png)

Select `db2020` in the `script` menu and press "jump down into a large rabbit hole". Next, it will ask you to put your phone in recovery mode (hold the C key and plug it into the computer)
Once that's done, FAR Manager should look like this

![justdaflaser choice](/_static/farman_jdf2.png)

Choose `bflash`, it stands for "break flash" and will let you "break" your phone in order to flash patches and go through the internal filesystem.

Justdaflasher says that you must flash MAIN after connect, just continue since you already should have your `.mbn` file around from the flashing step. It'll now start flashing things onto your phone

Once done, it asks you to "unplug the cable, reinsert the battery and press ok" as such: 
![justdaflaser replug](/_static/farman_jdf3.png)

It should now continue by itself, and ask you the same thing a second time and a third time.

Justdaflasher should then tell you this: 
![justdaflaser flash main first](/_static/farman_jdf4.png)

Press ok, a progress bar should appear and then it'll open a pane called `bflash:/` containing a file called memory. This is the phone's memory and we have to flash the main (`.mbn`) firmware first.

To do so, navigate on the opposite pane until you find your main firmware.
![justdaflaser flash main](/_static/farman_jdf5.png)

Once you've highlighted the `.mbn` firmware, press F5 (copy) and then C to copy the file to the opposite pane, justdaflasher is going to open a prompt, make sure that `as a babe image` is ticked and then you can click on "yeah, flash it"

![justdaflaser babe img](/_static/farman_jdf6.png)

It should take a while to flash the image, wait for it to finish and let's proceed to flashing the qamaker patch (`.vkp`)
Same thing, locate your qamaker patch, highlight it and copy it with F5. But this time, the box that should be ticked is `as a vkp patch`.

Once it's done you can just leave FAR Manager and reboot the phone by removing its battery, putting it back in and powering it on.

You now have a breaked DB2020 phone. If you want to access the breaked mode using justdaflasher to flash new plugins, you totally can now that you have the quick access patch, you just need to select the `qa2020` script instead of `db2020` and you should be brought back in a state where you can flash vkp patches

## Patching
### DB2010/DB2012 CID49 and before
This is way faster than the DB2020 method below since there's no need to flash a quick access patch, but there's a few specific things to take note of.
First, open FAR Manager. Then, press F11 and select `just da flasher`. Select your phone model, for this tutorial it's going to be a W810i, then press "jump down a large rabbit hole".

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf1.png)

The plugin will ask you to remove the battery, reseat it and then plug the phone to your computer while holding the `C` key.

Once it's done, you should see a screen with 4 options: 
- bflash ("broken flash", where you can flash patches)
- bfs ("broken file system", where you can browse all of the phone's filesystem)
- oflash ("official flash", which lets you flash firmwares)
- ofs ("official filesystem", same thing as broken file system but with limitations)

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf2.png)

Whenever you need to patch your phone, you're going to access the `bflash` mode, which lets you "copy" patches over so they can be flashed.
Upon pressing `bflash`, jdf is going to flash a "broken" bootloader, which lets you tamper with the internal firmware. It then prompts you to remove the cable, reseat the battery and press enter:

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf3.png)

After this screen, press ok and then plug the phone back in while holding the `C` key.

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf4.png)

You should then be greeted by a folder with `memory` in it, to flash a patch, go to the opposite pane, select a `.vkp` patch and copy it over by pressing F5, then "Copy", after which you should have this screen, make sure `as a vkp patch` is selected and press "yeah, flash it". If you want to remove a patch that has already been applied, you just select it and tick the "remove patch" box. 

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf5.png)

Once you're done flashing stuff to your phone. Select the two dots above `memory`, jdf should ask you "are you sure", press yes.
It then asks you to restore a firmware. Select **YES**. It should restore your regular bootloader now as pictured here.

![justdaflaser db2010/db2012](/_static/farman_db2010_jdf6.png)

Why does it have to do that ? Well remember earlier, when entering `bflash` mode, jdf flashed a "broken" bootloader which cannot boot the phone but is solely here to tamper with the firmware.

Once that's done, reseat the battery and restart your phone, it should work just fine with all the new patches.

### DB2020 
To patch your phone, you need to break it beforehand, once that's done and everything works, launch FAR Manager, open JDF, and select `qa2020` as the script now that QuickAccess has been flashed.

![justdaflaser qa2020](/_static/farman_jdf7.png)

Once that's done, press "jump down into a large rabbit hole", remove the battery, put it back in after 5 seconds and plug in your phone while holding C.

When JDF is done loading, this screen should appear
![justdaflaser qa2020](/_static/farman_jdf8.png)

Select `bflash`, and then this familiar screen should re-appear
![justdaflaser qa2020](/_static/farman_jdf9.png)

Now flashing patches is possible, as done before by selecting them in the other pane, copying them by pressing F5, selecting "Copy" and then selecting `as a vkp patch`.
![justdaflaser qa2020](/_static/farman_jdf10.png)

After patches are applied, unplug and reboot the phone, it should be patched.
