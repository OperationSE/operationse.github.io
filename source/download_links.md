## Kaijousuru Archives
This is one of the biggest Sony Ericsson files archive, it contains lots of firmwares and other extra things. Most of the firmwares it has are meant to work with [Omnius for SE](https://kaijousuru.com).
Here's the link to the archive [Kaijousuru Archives](https://archives.kaijousuru.com/)

## TopSony files
TopSony is an old forum that is broken, registrations can't be made and thus, you can't download any files from it if someone doesn't lend you an account for it.
That is why it has been scraped and all of the files are available either in [this Proton Drive folder](https://drive.proton.me/urls/BDTEBARJGW#3fXzAPn6lS1O) or on [archive.org as torrents/direct download](https://archive.org/download/tems_20250222) (the direct download files are the ones that are under 1GB, because uploading takes a very long time on Internet Archive, firmwares and custfiles are in torrent files)

## Iprotebe files
Iprotebe is a file hosting service targeted towards old phones, and it had quite a few Sony Ericsson files which are available in [this Proton Drive folder](https://drive.proton.me/urls/AQ1358PNAR#m27WWE7EV2XJ)
